# SVM-Image-classification-
## Overview

This project is focused on building a machine learning model to classify images of cats and dogs using deep learning techniques. The Jupyter Notebook Cat_Dog.ipynb contains the necessary code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and predictions.

## Features
Dataset loading and preprocessing

Data augmentation for improved model generalization

Support Vector Machine (SVM) implementation for classification

Model evaluation and accuracy measurement

Prediction on new images

## Requirements

To run this project, install the following dependencies:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

## Usage

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook Cat_Dog.ipynb

Follow the steps inside the notebook to preprocess data, train the model, and make predictions.

## Dataset

Ensure that you have the dataset of cat and dog images. If needed, download a dataset like Kaggle's Cats and Dogs dataset and update the paths accordingly in the notebook.

## Results

The trained model will be evaluated based on accuracy and loss metrics. The final model can be used for real-time image classification.

## Contributions

Feel free to modify the notebook and experiment with different architectures to improve the model performance.
